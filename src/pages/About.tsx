            Born from a simple belief that design should touch hearts, not just eyes.

              <p>
                It was a rainy Tuesday morning in 2018 when our founder, Sarah, sketched the first 
                Lovable logo on a coffee-stained napkin. She had just left her corporate job, 
                tired of creating soulless designs that no one remembered or cared about.
              </p>
              <p>
                "What if we could make people feel something?" she wondered. "What if every website, 
                every brand, every digital experience could be a warm hug instead of a cold handshake?"
              </p>
              <p>
                That simple question became our mission. We started small, working from Sarah's 
                living room with just a laptop and an endless supply of chamomile tea. But word 
                spread quickly about the "design studio that actually cares."

              <p>
                Five years later, we're still that same team of dreamers, just a bit bigger and 
                with more comfortable chairs. We believe that behind every pixel is a person, 
                and behind every person is a story worth telling beautifully.
              </p>
              <p>
                We don't just create designs; we craft experiences that make people smile, 
                websites that feel like home, and brands that customers genuinely love. 
                Because in a world full of noise, we choose to be the gentle whisper that 
                says "you matter."
